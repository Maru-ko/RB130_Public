###Octal

**define an `Octal` class**

**Implement `Octal#to_decimal` instance method**
*why?*)
This method can only be called on a class of `Octal`
â€¢ it is not a method inherited or implemented in `String` `Integer` or `Float` classes.

**Clue to implementing the method**

`'1'` to `1`

`'1234567'` to `342_391`

`'011'` to `9`

`'7777'` to `4095`
